### Final Steps to Activate Your Profile README:

1. **Create a new repository** named exactly:  
   → `https://github.com/ybouali/ybouali`

2. **Add this file as `README.md`** in the root

3. **Go to GitHub Settings → "Pages"** and enable **"Add a README to your profile"**

4. *(Optional)* Add a real banner image:
   - Upload to your repo: `assets/banner.jpg`
   - Replace the capsule link with: `![Banner](./assets/banner.jpg)`
